# Iris-flower-classification-analysis-Project
Iris flower classification using Machine Learning and Python using appropriate prediction methods and libraries. Used libraries are numpy , pandas , matplotlib and sklearn

What is machine learning?

Machine learning is about learning to predict something or extracting knowledge from data. ML is a part of artificial intelligence. ML algorithms build a model based on sample data or known as training data and based upon the training data the algorithm can predict something on new data.

Categories of Machine Learning :

Supervised machine learning: Supervised machine learning are types of machine learning that are trained on well-labeled training data. Labeled data means the training data is already tagged with the correct output.

Unsupervised machine learning: Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning doesnâ€™t have any tagged data. It learned patterns from untagged data. Basically, it creates a group of objects based on the input data/features.

Semi-supervised machine learning: Semi-supervised learning falls between supervised and unsupervised learning. It has a small amount of tagged data and a large amount of untagged data.

# Steps to Classify Iris Flower:

1. Load the data


2. Analyze and visualize the dataset

3. Model training.

4. Model Evaluation.

5. Testing the model.
